## Install R
R is freely available [here](https://cran.r-project.org/)

Note that the “base R” program that you get from the above link can work as a standalone analysis software, but we strongly recommend using a program like [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) to make your life easier. RStudio is the most popular, feature-rich, and user-friendly way to interact with R and develop your R scripts. 


## Learn About R
- The [R-bloggers site](https://www.r-bloggers.com) has a [great post](https://www.r-bloggers.com/the-5-most-effective-ways-to-learn-r/) featuring five ways to learn R with links to resources for each learning method:

- RStudio has also compiled a nice [compendium of R learning resources](https://www.rstudio.com/online-learning/).

- Emmanuel Paradis’ [“R for Beginners”](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Paradis-rdebuts_en.pdf) is a free book for introductory R topics:

- The “Personality Project” is a project led by William Revelle (author of the “psych” R package) and the [Personality Project website](http://personality-project.org/r/) hosts a series of tutorials for psychologists interested in learning R: 

- Code School’s [“Try R”](http://tryr.codeschool.com/) is a free tutorial that provides opportunities to practice using the R language in the comfort of your own browser window:


## Find Cool Packages for R!
After installing R and learning the basics, it’s time to explore the vast world of user-developed R packages. There are thousands of packages available for R, but here are some of our favorites (other than `psychmeta`, of course!). 

### `tidyverse`
The `tidyverse` package is actually a collection of packages that can help with data importation, data cleaning, data management, creating beautiful plots, and much more. Vist [here](https://www.tidyverse.org/) for more info about the packages included in the `tidyverse`. 

### `psych`
The `psych` package is a collection of resources for psychologists and has wonderful functions for factor analysis, reliability analysis, item analysis, and much more.

- CRAN documentation: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/psych/index.html 

### `apaTables`
The `apaTables` package is a great help for doing reproducible analyses in R. It can export R analyses to Word-format APA-style tables for common types of analyses (e.g., regression models, ANOVAs, correlation matrices).
- [CRAN documentation](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/apaTables/index.html)

### `metafor`
The `metafor` package is arguably the most popular package for meta-analysis in R. It has great tools for computing meta-regressions, doing publication-bias analyses, and plotting meta-analytic results.
