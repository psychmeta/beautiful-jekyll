## Install R!
R is freely available [here](https://cran.r-project.org/) from the "Comprehensive R Archival Network" (CRAN). 

Note that the “base R” program that you get from the above link can work as a standalone analysis software, but we strongly recommend using a program like [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) to make your life easier. [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) is the most popular, feature-rich, and user-friendly way to interact with R and develop your R scripts. 


## Learn About R!
There is a vertiable trove of introductory R resources on the Internet, but below are several resources you might find especially helpful if you're new to R. Bear in mind that most questions about R have already been answered by someone somewhere on the web, so Google will be your best friend as you set out on your R journey. 

- The [R-bloggers site](https://www.r-bloggers.com) has a [great post](https://www.r-bloggers.com/the-5-most-effective-ways-to-learn-r/) featuring five ways to learn R with links to resources for each learning method.

- RStudio has also compiled a nice [compendium of R learning resources](https://www.rstudio.com/online-learning/).

- Steven Nydick's ["Intro to R for Psychologists"](http://talklab.psy.gla.ac.uk/L1_labs/resources/Introduction_to_R_Guide.pdf) and Emmanuel Paradis’ [“R for Beginners”](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Paradis-rdebuts_en.pdf) are free e-books on introductory R topics.

- The “Personality Project” is a project led by William Revelle (author of the [`psych` R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/psych/index.html)) and the [Personality Project website](http://personality-project.org/r/) hosts a series of tutorials for psychologists interested in learning R. 

- Code School’s [“Try R”](http://tryr.codeschool.com/) is a free tutorial that provides opportunities to practice using the R language in the comfort of your own browser window.


## Find Cool Packages for R!
After installing R and learning the basics, it’s time to explore the vast world of user-developed R packages. There are thousands of packages available for R, but below are some of our favorites (other than `psychmeta`, of course!). You can also find a complete list of the R packages hosted on CRAN [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html).

### `tidyverse`
The `tidyverse` package is actually a collection of packages that can help with data importation, data cleaning, data management, creating beautiful plots, and much more. 
- [CRAN documentation](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyverse/index.html)
- [`tidyverse` webpage](https://www.tidyverse.org/)

### `metafor`
The `metafor` package is the most popular package for (non-psychometric) meta-analysis in R. It has great tools for computing meta-regressions, doing publication-bias analyses, and plotting meta-analytic results. Note that "escalc" objects generated by `psychmeta`'s meta-analysis functions are compatible with `metafor` so that you can flexibly analyze your data. 
- [CRAN documentation](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/metafor/index.html)
- [`metafor` webpage](http://metafor-project.org/)

### `psych`
The `psych` package is a collection of resources for psychologists and has wonderful functions for factor analysis, reliability analysis, item analysis, and much more. 
- [CRAN documentation](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/psych/index.html)
- [Introduction to `psych`](http://personality-project.org/r/overview.pdf)

### `apaTables`
The `apaTables` package is a great help for doing reproducible analyses in R. It can export R analyses to Word-format APA-style tables for common types of analyses (e.g., regression models, ANOVAs, correlation matrices).
- [CRAN documentation](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/apaTables/index.html)
